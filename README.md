# FormsApp_Communicate2-way
Using delegates example to send strings between forms
I struggled with communicating between 2 forms not quite a noobe but no pro either.
I needed to be able to send message between forms spent a lot of time trying to figure it out.
Usaully google is your friend but most searches were specific to end user.
I could not friend a simple downloadable sample.
So I posted a very simple example app here for others struggling with this.
Clicking button on form 1 sends text to form2 and vise versa.
